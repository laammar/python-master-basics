# Python Advanced — Synthetic Dataset Generation and Analysis

This project was developed during the advanced Python module of my Data Science master’s program.

The objective was to generate a synthetic dataset based on predefined rules, transform it into a structured format using Pandas, and perform basic analysis and visualization.

## Project contents

- A Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data generation logic (rule-based)
  - Dataset construction
  - Pandas DataFrame creation and manipulation
  - Export to CSV (and validation by re-import)
  - Aggregations and summaries
  - Visualizations with Matplotlib

## Concepts practiced

- Functions and structured programming
- Dictionaries and lists for dataset building
- Pandas (DataFrame, grouping, reshaping)
- File I/O (CSV export/import)
- Exploratory analysis and visualization
- Notebook organization and reproducibility

## Context

This is a learning-oriented academic project and reflects the structure required by the course assignment.
