## Notes on imports

The notebook imports a custom module (`Funciones.py`) that is located in the `basic/module/` directory.

When running the notebook locally, the working directory must allow Python to resolve this module (for example, by running the notebook from the project root or adjusting the Python path).

This setup reflects the original structure used during the assignment.
