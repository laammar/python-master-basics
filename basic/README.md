# Python Basics — Guess the Number Game

This project is an introductory Python exercise developed during the initial programming module of my Data Science master’s program.

The objective was to build an interactive game while practicing fundamental programming concepts and basic modularization.

## Project structure

- A Jupyter Notebook that runs the game and manages user interaction
- A custom Python module containing the core game logic and helper functions
- The notebook imports the module to separate logic from execution, as required by the assignment

## Concepts practiced

- Control flow (if / else)
- Loops
- Functions
- Input validation
- Modular code (custom Python module)
- Basic file handling

## Context

This project was designed as a learning-oriented academic exercise and reflects the structure required by the course.
