# Python Master Basics

This repository contains two academic Python projects developed during my Data Science, Big Data & Business Analytics master’s program at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The projects cover both foundational and intermediate Python concepts, progressing from basic programming logic to data generation, analysis, and visualization.

## Projects included

### 1. Guess the Number Game (Python Basics)
An interactive Python game featuring:
- Menu-driven user interaction
- Single-player and two-player modes
- Difficulty levels with limited attempts
- Input validation and control flow
- Game result storage in an Excel file
- Basic statistics visualization

This project focuses on core programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and file handling.

### 2. Synthetic Dataset Generation and Analysis (Python Advanced)
A data-oriented project that includes:
- Generation of synthetic hostnames based on predefined rules
- Construction of structured datasets using Python dictionaries and lists
- Creation and manipulation of Pandas DataFrames
- Data export to CSV and re-import validation
- Exploratory data analysis and aggregation
- Multiple visualizations using Matplotlib (bar charts, pie charts, grouped plots)

This project introduces data processing and visualization workflows commonly used in data analysis.

## Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
